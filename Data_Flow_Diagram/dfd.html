        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>The Level 0 DFD, or Context Diagram, provides a high-level overview of the University Management System (UMS) and its interactions with external entities. It shows the system as a single process, 0.0, interacting with two external entities: <strong>Student</strong> and <strong>Admin</strong>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Student</strong> interacts with the UMS to provide Personal Details, Course Requests, and Fee Payments. In return, the UMS provides the Student with Schedules, Grades, and Notifications.</li>
            <li><strong>Admin</strong> interacts with the UMS to provide Course Info, Rules/Policies, and Faculty Details. The UMS provides the Admin with Reports, Statistics, and System Alerts.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Level 1 DFD: High-Level System Processes</h2>
        <img src="image2.png" alt="Level 1 DFD: High-Level System Processes">
        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>The Level 1 DFD expands on the Context Diagram, breaking down the University Management System into its core high-level processes. These processes interact with each other, external entities (Student and Admin), and various data stores. The main processes identified are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1.0 Manage Admissions & Profile:</strong> Handles student application data and profile updates, interacting with the Student DB (D1).</li>
            <li><strong>2.0 Manage Academics & Registration:</strong> Manages course enrollment and scheduling, interacting with the Course DB (D2) and Student DB (D1).</li>
            <li><strong>3.0 Manage Examinations & Grades:</strong> Deals with exam scores and grade reports, interacting with the Grade DB (D3) and Course DB (D2).</li>
            <li><strong>4.0 Manage Fees & Finance:</strong> Processes payment details and generates receipts, interacting with the Finance DB (D4) and Student DB (D1).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Key System Processes</h2>
        <h3>1.0 Manage Admissions & Profile</h3>
        <p>This process is responsible for handling all aspects of student admissions and managing their personal profiles within the University Management System. It receives <strong>Application Data</strong> and <strong>Updated Profile</strong> information from the <strong>Student</strong>. This data is then stored and retrieved from the <strong>Student DB (D1)</strong>. The system ensures that student records are accurately maintained from their initial application through their academic journey.</p>
        <h3>2.0 Manage Academics & Registration</h3>
        <p>The "Manage Academics & Registration" process is central to the academic operations of the university. It handles <strong>Course Enrollment</strong> and <strong>Schedule</strong> requests from students. This process interacts with the <strong>Course DB (D2)</strong> to access course details and the <strong>Student DB (D1)</strong> to update student registration information. It also facilitates the input of <strong>Course Info, Rules/Policies, and Faculty Details</strong> by the <strong>Admin</strong>, ensuring that academic offerings are current and correctly managed.</p>
        <h3>3.0 Manage Examinations & Grades</h3>
        <p>This process focuses on the administration of examinations and the recording of student grades. It receives <strong>Exam Scores</strong> and generates <strong>Grade Reports</strong>, which are accessible to the <strong>Student</strong> and managed by the <strong>Admin</strong>. Data flows from and to the <strong>Grade DB (D3)</strong> for storing grade records, and it interacts with the <strong>Course DB (D2)</strong> for course-related grading information. This ensures accurate and timely dissemination of academic performance.</p>
        <h3>4.0 Manage Fees & Finance</h3>
        <p>The "Manage Fees & Finance" process handles all financial transactions related to student fees. It processes <strong>Fee Payments</strong> from the <strong>Student</strong> and manages <strong>Payment Details</strong> and <strong>Receipts</strong>. The <strong>Admin</strong> oversees financial operations, including potentially inputting financial rules and generating reports. This process primarily interacts with the <strong>Finance DB (D4)</strong> for financial records and the <strong>Student DB (D1)</strong> for student-specific billing and payment histories.</p>
