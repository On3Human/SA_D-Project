            <h2>What is a Use Case Diagram?</h2>
            <p>
                A Use Case Diagram is a behavioral diagram from the Unified Modeling Language (UML) that illustrates how users interact with a system. It captures the functional requirements of a system by showing the different ways users (actors) can interact with the system to achieve specific goals (use cases). Essentially, it provides a high-level view of the system's functionality and scope.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is a crucial tool in the early stages of system analysis and design, helping stakeholders understand the system's boundaries, its primary functions, and the roles of its users.
            </p>

            <h2>Key Components of a Use Case Diagram</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Actor:</strong> Represents a role that a user plays when interacting with the system. An actor can be a human user, another system, or an external device. It is typically drawn as a stick figure.</li>
                <li><strong>Use Case:</strong> Represents a specific functionality or a sequence of actions performed by the system that yields an observable result of value to a particular actor. It is typically drawn as an oval.</li>
                <li><strong>System Boundary:</strong> A rectangle that encloses the use cases and defines the scope of the system. Anything inside the boundary is part of the system, while actors are outside.</li>
                <li><strong>Associations (Relationships):</strong> Lines connecting actors to use cases, indicating that an actor participates in a use case.</li>
                <li><strong>Relationships Between Use Cases:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Include (&lt;&lt;include&gt;&gt;):</strong> Indicates that one use case incorporates the functionality of another use case. The included use case is necessary for the base use case to complete.</li>
                        <li><strong>Extend (&lt;&lt;extend&gt;&gt;):</strong> Indicates that one use case adds functionality to another use case under certain conditions. The extending use case is optional and augments the base use case.</li>
                        <li><strong>Generalization:</strong> Represents an inheritance relationship where a specialized use case inherits the behavior and meaning of a more general use case.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

        <section>
            <h2>Purpose and Benefits</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Requirements Elicitation:</strong> Helps in identifying and documenting functional requirements from the user's perspective.</li>
                <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Provides a clear and simple way to communicate system functionality to stakeholders, including non-technical ones.</li>
                <li><strong>Scope Definition:</strong> Clearly defines the boundaries and scope of the system, helping to prevent scope creep.</li>
                <li><strong>Test Case Generation:</strong> Use cases can be directly translated into test cases, ensuring that all defined functionalities are tested.</li>
                <li><strong>System Design:</strong> Serves as a foundation for more detailed design activities, such as class diagrams and sequence diagrams.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Example: Online Shopping System</h2>
            <p>Let's consider a simplified online shopping system to illustrate a use case diagram.</p>

            <div class="example-diagram">
                <h3>Actors:</h3>
                <ul>

                    <li><strong>Administrator:</strong> A person who manages products and orders.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Use Cases:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>View Products:</strong> Customer can browse available products.</li>
                    <li><strong>Add Product to Cart:</strong> Customer can add items to their shopping cart.</li>
                    <li><strong>Remove Product from Cart:</strong> Customer can remove items from their shopping cart.</li>
                    <li><strong>Checkout:</strong> Customer completes the purchase process.
                        <ul>
                            <li>&lt;&lt;include&gt;&gt; <strong>Process Payment:</strong> Part of the checkout process.</li>

            <h2>Simplified Visual Representation</h2>
            <p>
                A simplified visual representation of a Use Case Diagram might look like this:

        </section>
            <h1>Full Use Case Description</h1>
               1- Student : The student must log in into the UMS after log in he must verify passwords and allow him to access the website if he enter correct password only ! ,  After log in he can do a lot of things like he can manage courses ( add course but must be 7 courses at most and must be passed all previous requirments , He can also delete courses and must be 4 courses al least ) .
He can also Edit his info like his photo , No of phone or  Email . 
He can show his grades in any subject.
He can bill payments by visa or cash and connect with finance dept.

            <br>
             2- Instructor : He can Manage students grade and publish courses when admin accept it.
He can manage course also by add or delete by his available seats in each course.

            <br>
            3- Finance dept : He can interact with payments from any students and always check if and problem in any payment.

            <br>
            4- Admin : Admin can modifyy all things in UMS and show the Bill reports and by his accepence no one can do anything.
